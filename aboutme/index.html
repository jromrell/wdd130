    <p>Hi everybody, I am a computer science major and I am currently a
        junior. After my first progamming class i knew that i wanted to 
        do computer science.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the things I love are anything being active. I love to 
        play sports and go to the gym. It is also always nice to kick back and 
        relax at times. After school I hope that I can become a software
        engineer or someting related. I am very interested in learinig more about 
        web design and to discover if I would want to do something with 
        web desigh as well. 
    </p>
