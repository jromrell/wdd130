      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Main Page Growing up I always enjoyed hearing and getting to know random facts about random things. With this website 
        being StatFacts, it will satisfy that curiosity you have about whatever state you live in, or you could be traveling
         through. The first two states that this site has is Idaho and Utah. I picked Idaho and Utah to be the first two states
          because I have lived in Idaho for most of my life, and Utah would be the most visited state of mine. As you explore
           StateFacts you will learn all sorts of new things about all sorts of new places!

      <h3>Idaho</h3>
      <p>
        IDAHO People will come to this site out of curiosity. Fun facts are always a cool and fun thing to know and they are always
         very entertaining. On the Idaho page, people would come here for if they are curious about facts about the state of Idaho.
          For instance, you probably knew Idaho was the number one producer of potatoes, but did you know that they are the number 
          one producers of trout as well? The state of Idaho is known as the “Gem State” because you can find nearly 75 types of
           precious stones in our state. Idaho is known as the lentil capital of the world. Idaho is known for their potatoes so it
            probably won’t come to any surprise that the world’s largest potato is in Idaho as well. This page is to entertain visotors
             and educate them on the state of Idaho.
